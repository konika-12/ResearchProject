# Prediction And Visualization Of The FMCG Stocks Prices
This research attempts to understand the principle of Stock price forecasting and research which algorithms are the best suited to perform the evaluative task of predicting stock trends at the time of the Covid-19 and Ukraine-Russia Wars. Additionally, the stock trends visualizations will also be done. Ten yearâ€™s worth of historical stock price information will be made available for the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector by India's NSE and BSE. The years 2012 to 2022 will be chosen for the historical dataset. This work suggests the Deep Learning (DL)-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Algorithm and Auto-ARIMA. Additionally, the outcomes show that the Power BI platform can give an analysis of stock price patterns in an original and efficient manner. The research aims to forecast the churns for the upcoming years.
